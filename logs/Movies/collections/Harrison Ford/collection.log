[2022-01-16 14:55:04,229] [builder.py:2235]           [DEBUG]    | {'summary.value': 'Legendary Hollywood Icon Harrison Ford was born on July 13,\xa01942 in Chicago, Illinois. His family\xa0history includes a strong lineage of actors, radio personalities, and models.\xa0Harrison attended public high school in Park\xa0Ridge, Illinois where he was a member of the school Radio Station WMTH.\xa0Harrison worked as the lead voice for sports reporting at WMTH for several\xa0years.\xa0Acting wasn’t a major interest to\xa0Ford until his junior year at Ripon College when he first took an acting class. Harrison Ford’s career started in 1964 when he travelled to\xa0California in search of a voice-over job.\xa0He never received that position, but instead signed a contract with\xa0Columbia Pictures where he earned $150 weekly to play small fill in roles in\xa0various films.\n\nThrough the 60’s Harrison\xa0worked on several TV shows including Gunsmoke,\xa0Ironside, Kung Fu, and American Style. It wasn’t until 1967 that Harrison received\xa0his first credited role in the Western film, A Time for Killing. Dissatisfied with the meager roles he was being\xa0offered, Ford took a hiatus from acting to work as a self-employed carpenter.\xa0This seemingly odd diversion turned out to be a blessing in disguise for\xa0Harrison’s acting career when he was soon hired by famous film producer George\xa0Lucas. This was a turning point in\xa0Harrison’s life that led to him be casted in milestone roles such as Hans Solo\xa0and Indiana Jones.\n\nSince his most famous\xa0roles in the Star Wars Trilogy and Raiders\xa0of the Lost Ark, Harrison Ford has starred in over 40 films. Many criticize his recent work, saying his\xa0performances have been lackluster leading to commercially disappointing films. Harrison has always worked hard to protect his off-screen\xa0private life, keeping details about his children and marriages quite. He has a total of five children including one\xa0recent adoption with third and current wife Calista Flockhart.
